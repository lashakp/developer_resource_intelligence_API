Developer Resource Intelligence API

A production-ready, explainable recommendation API for curated developer learning resources — combining deterministic scoring with optional ML-based ranking.

This system is designed to solve developer information overload by enabling structured discovery, transparent ranking, and safe ML extensibility, all exposed through a clean, versioned FastAPI backend.

 Why This Project Exists

Developers rely on search engines to find learning resources, but search results are rarely optimized for:

Skill relevance (backend vs data vs devops)

Learning intent (tools vs documentation vs courses)

Source trustworthiness

Explainability of ranking decisions

This project addresses those gaps by introducing a controlled, explainable recommendation engine that prioritizes clarity, stability, and extensibility over black-box behavior.

 Core Capabilities

 Skill-based discovery

 Deterministic, explainable ranking

 Optional ML-based ranking with safe fallback

 Tested ML vs rule enforcement

 Clean service-oriented architecture

 Docker-ready for deployment

 Fully documented API (Swagger UI)

 Key Concepts
Skill Cluster

High-level developer domains such as:

backend

frontend

data

devops

mobile

Resource Type

The form of the learning resource:

tool

documentation

course

article

Domain Weight

A heuristic authority score assigned during data enrichment.

Higher values indicate more established or trusted domains

Used as a primary ranking signal

Fully explainable and deterministic

 Architecture Overview

The system is intentionally decomposed into clear, testable layers:

API (FastAPI)
│
├── Routes        → HTTP interface & validation
├── Services      → Business logic orchestration
├── Ranking       → ML vs deterministic enforcement
├── Scoring       → Transparent heuristic logic
├── ML Layer      → Optional trained model
├── Database      → SQLite (read-only, seeded)
└── ETL Pipeline  → Extract → Transform → Enrich


This separation ensures:

Predictable behavior

Easy testing

Safe extensibility

Clear ownership of responsibilities

 API Endpoints

All endpoints are versioned under /v1.

 Health Check
GET /v1/health


Confirms service availability.

 Discovery Endpoints
Available Skills
GET /v1/skills

Resource Types
GET /v1/resource-types

Domains
GET /v1/domains

Dataset Statistics
GET /v1/stats


Provides high-level insight into:

Total resources

Top skills

Top domains

Resource type distribution

 Filter Debugging
GET /v1/debug/availability


Shows valid combinations of:

skill → resource_type

This prevents invalid queries returning empty results unexpectedly.

 Recommendations
GET /v1/recommendations

Required Query Parameters

skill

Optional Query Parameters

limit (pagination)

offset (pagination)

resource_type

min_domain_weight

Example
/v1/recommendations?skill=data&resource_type=tool&min_domain_weight=3

 Ranking System
Deterministic Scoring (Default)

Every resource is scored using transparent heuristics:

Domain authority (domain_weight)

GitHub bonus

Resource type weighting

Properties:

Explainable

Debuggable

Stable

Always available

ML-Based Ranking (Optional)

Lightweight linear ranking model

Loaded lazily at runtime

Automatically enabled when present

Gracefully disabled when missing

The API response explicitly reports which ranking mode was used:

"ranking_mode": "ml"


or

"ranking_mode": "deterministic"


This avoids silent ML failure — a common production anti-pattern.

 Testing Strategy

The system is tested at multiple levels:

Unit Tests

Scoring correctness

Ranking consistency

Integration Tests

ML ranking activation

Deterministic fallback enforcement

Identical API contracts regardless of ranking mode

This guarantees system stability under all conditions.

 Database Layer

SQLite used for portability and simplicity

SQLAlchemy ORM

Read-only workload

Database seeded deterministically

The presence of resources.db confirms a complete and operational data layer.

 Deployment

The application is fully Dockerized.

docker build -t dev-resource-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 dev-resource-api


Once running:
